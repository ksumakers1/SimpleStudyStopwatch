# SimpleStudyStopwatch

The purpose of this program is to assist students with studying at home (online school, homework, etc.), especially those who find themselves often feeling demotivated and losing track of time. The main idea is that seeing every second you've wasted doing anything other than studying will compel you to study and finish everything on time. It also makes tracking goals (e.g. studying for 3 hours a day) easier and contains a feature, allowing you to track the total time spent learning and on each subject.

This project was created purely for my education and use.
